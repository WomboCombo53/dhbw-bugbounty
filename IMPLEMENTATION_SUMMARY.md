# Implementation Summary

## Project: DHBW Bug Bounty Tracker

### Overview
This project implements a comprehensive bug bounty tracking system using React.js with a complete security-focused CI/CD pipeline as per the requirements.

### Completed Features

#### 1. React.js Bug Bounty Tracking Website ✅
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 with Vite 7 for fast builds
- **Bug Submission Form**: Allows users to submit security vulnerabilities with:
  - Bug title and detailed description
  - Severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
  - Target company name
  - Reporter email
  - Optional bounty amount
- **Bug Tracking Dashboard**: Displays all submitted bugs with:
  - Color-coded severity badges
  - Submission timestamps
  - Status tracking
  - Responsive design for mobile/desktop

#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline with Security Focus ✅

The pipeline implements all required stages with proper quality gates:

**a. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** ✅
- Uses Syft/Anchore for SBOM generation
- Generates CycloneDX JSON format
- Artifacts stored for audit trails

**b. SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** ✅
- CodeQL integration for JavaScript/React analysis
- Identifies security vulnerabilities in source code
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- All alerts addressed and resolved

**c. SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** ✅
- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- Trivy scanning for comprehensive vulnerability detection
- SARIF reports uploaded to GitHub Security
- Validates CVSS scores

**d. Secret Scanning** ✅
- Gitleaks integration for detecting hardcoded secrets
- Scans entire git history
- Full repository coverage

**e. Build Process** ✅
- Automated React application build
- Build artifacts stored for deployment
- Only proceeds if security scans pass

**f. Container Build & Scanning** ✅
- Multi-stage Docker build (Node 20 slim + nginx alpine)
- Optimized image size
- Container pushed to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Trivy container image scanning

**g. Image Signing** ✅
- Cosign-based keyless image signing
- Sigstore integration
- Signature verification before deployment

#### 3. Quality Gate Implementation ✅

The quality gate enforces all three required conditions:

1. **Secret Detection** ✅
   - Pipeline fails immediately if secrets are found
   - Gitleaks action blocks the workflow

2. **CVSS >= 7.0 Threshold** ✅
   - Checks npm audit for HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
   - Validates container scan results
   - Pipeline fails if vulnerabilities exceed threshold
   - Evaluates both dependency and container vulnerabilities

3. **Image Signature Validation** ✅
   - Cosign signature verification
   - Pipeline fails if signature is invalid or missing
   - Deployment blocked without valid signature

#### 4. Kubernetes Deployment ✅

- Complete Kubernetes manifests created:
  - Deployment with 3 replicas
  - Service (LoadBalancer)
  - Ingress with TLS configuration
- Security hardening:
  - Non-root user execution
  - Read-only root filesystem
  - Dropped all capabilities except NET_BIND_SERVICE
  - Resource limits defined
  - Liveness and readiness probes
- Dry-run deployment in pipeline
- Image reference uses signed digest

### Security Highlights

1. **Zero Security Vulnerabilities**: All dependencies validated
2. **Least Privilege**: Explicit permissions on all GitHub Actions jobs
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (SAST, SCA, secrets, container scanning)
4. **Signed Artifacts**: All container images signed with Cosign
5. **Secure Containers**: Non-root user, minimal capabilities, read-only filesystem

```

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Build Application**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Build Container**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t bugbounty-tracker ./frontend
   ```

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

### CI/CD Pipeline Flow

```
Push/PR → SBOM Generation
       → Secret Scan (Quality Gate #1)
       → SAST (CodeQL)
       → SCA (Quality Gate #2)
       → Build Application
       → Build Container
       → Scan Container (Quality Gate #2)
       → Sign Image
       → Verify Signature (Quality Gate #3)
       → Quality Gate Evaluation
       → Deploy to Kubernetes (if main/master)
```

### Quality Gate Results
